## Interview Structure
Software Engineer (SWE) and Software Development Engineer (SDE) interviews are primarily technical. <br>
Technical interviews, at the low level, consist primarily of algorithm design, data structure usage, dynamic programming (think recursion) and some system design (for higher level positions). <br>
Usually, the interview cycle will start with an initial coding challenge to weed out applicants. If you've practiced Leetcode or Hackerrank problems, they're fairly comprable. <br>
Generally the question will be an algo design question with test cases that you need to pass. A code editor will be provided in the challenge and you can run/test/debug with your own input or using their provided sample cases. <br>
<br>
If you pass the first round coding challenge, you'll get upped to the next round. Phone interview. This is the scary part, but honestly has its benefits. The phone interview is also a technical interview. You get matched with an 
engineer who works at the company you're interviewing at and will provide you with another algorithm design/data structs question. This question may be harder or easier than the coding challenge, but for the most part prepare for 
it to be harder. They'll provide you a shared text editor (i.e. Coderpad) where you'll write out your implementation and sometimes they'll have a run/compile button at the top, sometimes they won't. <br>
One major benefit that doesn't get talked about enough regarding phone interviews is that you're actually talking to a human being, not a computer that grades your code. This means that you can kinda goad the interviewer into 
providing you tips and hints about the implemetation. Sometimes when you're implementing a solution, the interviewer may chime in with something along the lines of "you sure you want to do that?". That's a sign. Don't do that. <br> 

### What to do in an interview:
An important thing to consider when going into a phone interview is that the interviewer isn't solely looking for the 'correct' solution. They're looking at your thought processes when you're trying to solve the solution. <b>The worst possible thing you could do in an interview is freeze up and not talk about what you're thinking.</b> <br>

Don't start coding right away. <br>

Think about your options and talk about the benefits and negatives of each. Run through all the data structures you can think of and make your choice at the end.<br> 

Sometimes you don't use a data structure that much. <br>

Show that you know what you're implementing, don't just implement it as if you had remembered the solution online. <br>

Stay calm. Breathe. <br>

Draw. It. Out. Sometimes, if you're a strong enough candidate, the round after the coding challenge isn't a phone interview. It's an on-site, whiteboard interview. Be ready to show what you're thinking. <br>
